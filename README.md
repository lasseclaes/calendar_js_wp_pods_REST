# calendar_js_wp_pods_REST
Cowboy-coded calendar

This is a hastely coded calendar - cowboy style - to show some ways of working with dates in JS, PODS, WP REST API etc. 

It shows some ways of using console.log, dates, functions etc. 

This code is a first draft - an exploration of what's possible, and it has not been properly commented nor cleaned up and streamlined - I'm afraid. So there's plenty of room for improvement... Please, do so.

Good luck & enjoy!
