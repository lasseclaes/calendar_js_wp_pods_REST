# calendar_js_wp_pods_REST
Cowboy-coded calendar

This is a hastely coded calendar to show some ways of working with dates in JS, PODS, WP REST API etc.

It shows some ways of using console.log, dates, functions etc. 

This code is a cowboy-ish first draft - an exploration of what's possible, and it has not been cleaned up and streamlined 
- I'm afraid. So there's plenty of room for improvement... Please, do so.

Good luck & enjoy!
